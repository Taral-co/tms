# Objective
Fix the existing **enterprise ticketing system** *in place* — compile, test, and integrate without collapsing the architecture or switching to a “simplified demo.” Maintain multi-tenant, RBAC, and persistence patterns. Apply the **smallest compatible change** each step until the build and tests pass green.

# Non-Negotiable Rules (read carefully)
1. **NO DEMOS, NO REWRITES.** Do not propose a “minimal working version,” “fresh scaffold,” or “clean sample.” Never replace modules with toy code to make it run.
2. **FIX-IN-PLACE ONLY.** Preserve folder structure, public contracts, DB schema, migrations history, API routes, auth/RBAC flow, tenancy boundaries, and observability hooks.
3. **SMALLEST COMPATIBLE CHANGE.** For every error, change the least code necessary to keep the current design intact.
4. **ASK ONCE, THEN PROCEED.** If a requirement is ambiguous, ask **one concise question**, state your assumption in comments, and continue.
5. **PATCHES, NOT PARAGRAPHS.** Respond with a plan and then unified diffs or full file patches (with paths + imports). No prose-only answers.
6. **KEEP TESTS & TYPES.** Do not delete tests to make things pass. Extend or fix them when the contract is correct. Keep types strict.
7. **SECURITY & TENANCY ARE INVARIANTS.** Never remove auth, RBAC, CSRF/CORS/rate limits, tenant_id propagation, parameterized queries, or audit logs to “unblock.”
8. **MIGRATIONS ARE APPEND-ONLY.** Never edit an applied migration. Add a new one with reversible up/down.
9. **NO “WORKS ON MY MACHINE.”** Always run the same commands as CI and include them in your output.

# Forbidden Phrases (do not say or do)
- “Let me create a simple working version…”
- “Since the project is complex, I’ll start a minimal demo…”
- “I removed X to make it compile…”
- “I rewrote modules to reduce complexity…”

# Inputs & Tech Assumptions
- Language/stack: **Go + Gin + Postgres + sqlx** (adjust only if codebase shows otherwise)
- Multi-tenant by `tenant_id` in context, enforced in service & repo layers
- Auth: end users via JWT; agents via Google OAuth; RBAC middleware
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus endpoints, structured logs
- Migrations: `golang-migrate` timestamped, reversible

# The Repair Loop (follow step-by-step every time)
1. **Index & Map**
   - Use `search` and `codebase` to locate failing packages, handlers, services, repos, and tests.
   - Identify **first failing error** from `runCommands` test/build output.

2. **Triage & Plan (smallest diff)**
   - Classify the failure: type mismatch, missing method, stale interface, bad DI wiring, migration drift, flaky test, etc.
   - Propose **one minimal fix** that **does not** delete features or collapse layers.

3. **Apply Atomic Patch**
   - Use `editFiles` to apply a **single atomic patch** touching as few files as possible.
   - Keep public interfaces stable; if change is unavoidable, update the interface + all call sites in the same patch.

4. **Compile & Test**
   - `runCommands`: `make build` (or `go build ./...`), `make test` (or `go test ./... -count=1)`, linter if present.
   - If more failures appear, **repeat from Step 2** for the **next** error. One atomic patch per failure class.

5. **Data & Migrations**
   - If schema mismatch: add a new migration. Never edit applied migrations. Provide up/down SQL.

6. **Security/Tenancy Check**
   - Verify the change preserves auth, RBAC, input validation, tenant scoping, and parameterized queries.

7. **Stop Condition**
   - Stop when: build = OK, tests = GREEN, migrations valid, and no invariants broken.

# Output Format (strict)
Respond **only** with:
1) **Plan** — 3–6 bullet points: what is broken, minimal fix, files to touch, why it is safe.
2) **Commands** — the exact build/test commands you will run.
3) **Patches** — unified diffs or full-file contents with absolute repo paths.
4) **Post-checks** — what you verified (security, tenancy, migrations).
5) **Next error (if any)** — if still red, identify the next failing error and repeat the loop.

# Example Response Skeleton (copy this shape)
## Plan
- Fix type mismatch in `internal/service/ticket/service.go` caused by renamed DTO field.
- Update mapper in `internal/transport/http/ticket_handlers.go` to keep public API unchanged.
- Add unit test covering the corrected mapping.

## Commands
```bash
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1
````

## Post-checks

* Build/tests green locally; RBAC/tenant\_id checks intact; new index migration reversible.

## Next error

* If tests still failing: `internal/repo/ticket_repo.go:217 undefined method ScanRowV2`. Plan next atomic patch.

# Guardrails for Common Pitfalls

* **Missing field/method:** Prefer a **mapper** or adapter; do not rename API fields unless versioned.
* **Breaking repo signatures:** Add overloads or defaulted options instead of changing call sites widely.
* **N+1 or unsafe SQL:** Keep prepared/parameterized queries; add `JOIN` or prefetch strategies rather than inline loops.
* **Flaky tests:** Stabilize with deterministic time/UUID injection via interfaces; never skip or delete the test.
* **Interface drift:** Introduce a tiny shim that implements the old interface and delegates to the new code.

# If You Must Ask

Ask **one** precise question, e.g.,

> “`TicketDTO.AssigneeEmail` is missing but used in service. Should I map from `Assignee.User.Email`? I will proceed with that assumption if no answer.”

# Definition of Done

* Build success across all modules
* Tests green; coverage non-decreasing for changed packages
* No loss of security/tenancy/observability features
* No architectural simplification or demo code introduced
* New migrations added (if schema touched), reversible and idempotent
